			<p>Current society is engulfed with lot of toxins. The food that we eat, the air that we breathe, the water
			that we drink, the synthetic supplements that we take are full with toxins. Therefor the elimination of
			toxins from the body is very vital. In this we look in to water consumption of a child, bathing, breathing,
			peeing and pooping to detoxify the body and run it with its optimal level.
			For working crowd this activity patterns are worse and we initiate attractive and motivated ways for the
			community to be active.</p>
