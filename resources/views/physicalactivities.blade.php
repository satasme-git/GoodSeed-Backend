			<p>In the era of our ancestors, majority of their daily work involved in physical activities. But sadly, the current society
is full with sedentary lifestyles and daily activities have become limited around a TV, computer, phone ect…
Limited physical activities also is a main cause of childhood obesity. This occurs due to lack of garden space
available to play at home, kids are full time involved in indoor computers, TV and phones since they are not
associated with friends. Another aspect is that parents have involved kids in many tuition classes where they don’t
have time to play with the friends. These sedentary lifestyles have a double blow on obesity as in once side the
unhealthy food that consumed regularly by the children unknowingly and they don’t get burn since they don’t
perform activities. In majority of the cases both the parents are working and since they are not around, they don’t
allow their children to go out and play fearing that the child will associate strangers.
Once the child is obesed they don’t get accepted among the active children and get bullied by the others and it
causes them to refuse working with groups and make them inactive in studies as well. This will become a major
threat to the future unemployed number in the country.
The same reasons above and lack of sleep elevates the stress levels of the children and it has a positive
relationship with obesity.</p>
