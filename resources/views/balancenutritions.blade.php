			<p>In the modern society most of the people suffer from “Malnutrition”. We are not talking about the malnutrition
			which Somalia, Ethiopia is facing, what we meant was, even though people load food in to their body, they are not
			nutritious. They are full with easy life toxins and waste which affects the immune system. Because of this, various
			deadly diseases have become a huge treat to the society.
			In this, we have given prominence to make people aware of the nature of deceases, what cause the problems,
			what prevention steps we could get to stop or minimize it.</p>

	<h3>Customizing and Standardizing the Single Serving Quantity.</h3>
	<p>Studies have shown that along with poor quality meals, people use to consume a big portion of a meal plate given
	on a single serving. The single serving potion of the traditionalist (age group 1922 – 1944) has grown bigger
	comparing with the generation Z (age group 1997 afterwards). Along with this, its shows that people are
	consuming the full potion (whether it’s served in a plate or served in takeaway packs) which comes to the
	conclusion that

<ol>
	<li>What people consume is not quality food.</li>
	<li>Poor quality is given in big single potions.</li>
	<li>The whole single potion is eaten by the consumer.</li>
</ol>
	 
	Since this has a direct correlation with rapidly growing deadly diseases and since various restaurants have their own designs and sizes to attract customers, we have initiated a customized takeaway packs to standardize the quantity of a single potion. This will make consumers to have the same quantity of food wherever they buy their food. There are 3 types of commonly used takeaway packs. 1. Cardboard boxes along with lunch sheets. 2 plastic boxes. 3 different types of form boxes. All these commonly used takeaway packs are directly contributing to cancer. Lunch sheets, plastics &amp; forms are the byproducts of oil (Fossil Fuels). Manufactures use a lot of chemicals to
	produce them and they release toxic chemicals when they exposed to heat.
	When it comes to human health, the best solution came out was the aluminum foil packs. Comparing to the health effects of using plastic &amp; polythene, using aluminum foils to wrap warm food has zero effects on human health and
	since they are recyclable it has less effects to the environment as well.
	Human consciousness should shape the commerce on the planet but right now commerce is changing the human consciousness in the planet.</p>
