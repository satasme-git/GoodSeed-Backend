cells throughout the body. Your adrenal gland releases the stress hormones cortisol, epinephrine also
known as adrenaline and norepinephrine. As these hormones travel through your blood stream, they
easily reach your blood vessels and heart. Adrenaline causes your heart to beat faster and raises your
blood pressure, overtime causing hypertension. Cortisol can also cause the endothelium or inner lining
of blood vessels to not function normally. This is an early step in triggering the process of atherosclerosis

obesity and related other deadly diseases.
Stress hormones affect immune cells in a variety of ways. Initially, they help prepare to fight invades and
heal after injury. But chronic stress can dampen function of some immune cells. Make you more
susceptible to infections and slow the rate you heal. Chronic stress also causes aging, acne, hair loss,
sexual dysfunction, headaches, mussel tensions, difficulty concentrating, fatigue and irritability. In this,
